    "\n",
    "Given a pair of matrices **A**,**B**, for any **C** in the span **s(A,B)**, it can be represented as a sequential product of a series of **A**s and **B**s.\n",

    "**Proof** Each **C** is the root of a tree representing how we reach **C** through matrix multiplications. Then based on the associative property of matrix multiplication, we prove 1.\n",
